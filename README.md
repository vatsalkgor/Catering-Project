# Catering-Project
This java desktop application is developed for a local catering company whose requirements was a standalone software which is used to 
track the records for their items and add new items as well as edit them in the first place. The second requirement was to generate a PDF 
File depending on what their client demand and able to generate a table based menu for each client. This software has met all the 
requirements and they are happily using this standalone software.
